# Image Classification using keras

## Meet my twin cats, Claudia and Lucy

![Lucy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astandri/My-Projects/master/MyCat%20Classification%20with%20Keras/Lucy/Lucy7.jpg)

In this project, I'll try to make a model to classify which one is Claudia, which one is Lucy.

To summarize, here's activities covered in this project:
1. **Data collection**
	took 100 samples of photos for both of them manually
2. **Data Preprocessing**
	Using OpenCV with the helps from matplotlib and pandas, I preprocess the raw images to become a clean dataset stored in dataframe. 
	I further split this dataset to 80:20 ratio for Testing purpose
3. **Model Building**
4. **Training and Validation**
5. **Optimization**
6. **Prediction**
