# Image Classification using keras

## Meet my twin cats, Claudia and Lucy

In this project, I'll try to make a model to classify which one is Claudia, which one is Lucy.

To summarize, here's activities covered in this project:
1. **Data collection**, took 120 samples of photos for both of them manually
2. **Data Preprocessing**, Using OpenCV with the helps from matplotlib and pandas, I preprocess the raw images to become a clean dataframe
3. **Model Building**
4. **Training and Validation**
5. **Optimization**
6. **Prediction**
