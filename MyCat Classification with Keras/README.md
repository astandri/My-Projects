#Image Classification using keras

##Meet my twin cats, Claudia and Lucy

In this project, I'll try to make a model to classify which one is Claudia, which one is Lucy.

To summarize, here's activities covered in this project:
	1. 	*Data collection*
		took 120 samples of photos for both of them manually
	2.	*Data Preprocessing*
		Using OpenCV with the helps from matplotlib and pandas, I preprocess the raw images to become a clean dataframe
	3.	*Model Building*
	4.	*Training and Validation*
	5.	*Optimization*
	6.	*Prediction*
